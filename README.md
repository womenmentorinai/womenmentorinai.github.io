## Women Mentoring @ AAAI-21

#### What? 
A virtual event to give women students and early-career researchers the opportunity to meet some of the women that lead our field. This is a venue for discussing issues relevant to pursuing a successful career in AI, connecting with peers, and establishing mentor/mentee relationships that we hope will extend beyond this single event. No submissions are required, but this event is **open to registered participants only**.

#### When? 
Friday, February 5, 1:30 - 3:00 PM PT

#### Where? 
TBD

#### Who are the mentors?
Coming soon!
