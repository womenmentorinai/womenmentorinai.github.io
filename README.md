### Welcome!

This year's event will be virtual, but the aim is still the same: to give women students in AI the opportunity to meet some of the great women that lead our field. This is a venue for discussing issues relevant to pursuing a successful career in AI, connecting with peers, and establishing mentor/mentee relationships that we hope will extend beyond this single event. No submissions are required, but this event is **open to registered participants only**.
